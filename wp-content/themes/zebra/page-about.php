    <div class="col-text"><p><b>Seven years after his viral single “Ima Read,” performer,songwriter and producer Zebra Katz returns to present his debutalbum, LESS IS MOOR.</b></p>
  <p>Written and produced between Berlin and London, LESS IS MOORfeatures guest appearances by Shygirl and S. Ruston, with a myriadof star co-producers such as Sega Bodega, Tony Quattro, and fellowRed Bull Music Academy graduate, Torus. Amidst all this talent,there’s rarely a down moment on the album.</p>
  <p>Together, these tracks capture sides of Zebra Katz the world hasyet to see and reveal his artistic versatility. His multipleinspirations are channeled into a series of high-energy bangers,all of which required years of collaboration to complete, a DIYattitude, and a commitment to a high concept without excessproduction.</p>
  <p>Recent singles “IN IN IN” and “LOUSY” are examples of Zebra Katz’desire to repossess his narrative, exploring issues like the Blackexperience and sexuality, all the while mixing in devastatingruminations on the life of a star: “they all love when you dead /
  and you six underground.”</p>
  <p>LESS IS MOOR will havelisteners on their heels, especially in moments that show ZebraKatz’s talent for improvisation and drawing on the moment. Thefreestyle on “ZAD DRUMZ” came about after an improvised session atRed Bull in Berlin with co-producer Torus. “INTRO” was made at aparty loft in Berlin. The gabber-oriented sound reflected thechaotic sounds of the party below. “All I wanna do is keep thedance floor jumping,” sings Zebra Katz on “ISH,” the next single inline for release. “NECKLACE,” a guitar-strummed slow jam, is a raremoment of respite on an otherwise high-energy album. The very nexttrack, “SLEEPN” jumps back in with a bubblegum beat and subversivelyrics: “blackface, war paint / throw a hex on ‘em.” “LICK IT NSPLIT” is the album’s sexy and high-spirited ending featuringShygirl.</p>

<p>Born Ojay Morgan, Zebra Katz, is a first-generationJamaican-American born in West Palm Beach, Florida. Morgan’sartistic days began early: his senior thesis at the Eugene LangCollege of Liberal Arts at The New School found him premiering“Moor Contradictions,” a precursor to LESS IS MOOR that combinedperformance art with music at La Mama Theatre in 2007. Skip aheadto 2012, when the music world explodes over Zebra Katz’ssensational hit, “Ima Read.” Picked up by Diplo’s Mad Decentimprint Jeffree's, the track garnered further popularity when itran for 11 minutes on a Rick Owens runway at Paris Fashion Week.The next five years found Zebra Katz touring nonstop in Europe andthe United States, delivering memorable and genre-breaking liveperformances at venues like the Broad Museum in Los Angeles, theNew Museum in New York, the Metropolitan Museum, MoMA PS1, BrooklynMuseum, and Art Basel in Switzerland. It was during this sameperiod that Morgan released the mixtapes Champagne and DRKLNG; twoEPS, Winter Titty and Nu Renegade, a collaboration with LeilaArab.
</p>
<p>Zebra Katz wanted to dive into production for LESS IS MOOR immediately afterreleasing Nu Renegade, but an exciting new opportunity took himaway from the project: from 2017-2018, Zebra Katz joined theGorillaz on their Humanz tour and was featured on the tracks, “SexMurder Party,” “The Apprentice,” and “Out of Body,” which alsofeatured Kilo Kish and Imani Vonsha.</p>
<p>For years, Zebra Katz has been working as an independent andself-managed artist, thriving despite the lack of backing from amajor label or a debut studio album. Now, with greater supportbehind him, LESS IS MOORannounces a deeper look into the sonic universe of Zebra Katz. Thealbum stays true to the off-the-cuff way that Zebra Katz initiallystarted to make music seven years ago but it finds the musiciannewly empowered and unafraid of being noise-driven, biting,caustic. Nor is he afraid to draw inspiration from diverse sourceslike Little Richard, Nina Simone, James Baldwin, and Grace Jones.Sexually charged and abrasive, LESS IS MOOR is a bold, sonicexperiment that meshes industrial hip-hop with drum ‘n’ bass andunidentifiable sonic territory.</p>
<p>Used as early as the Middle Ages, the word “moor” refers to theblack Muslims of Northern Africa. Today it simply means black andis synonymous with “negro.” When Zebra Katz says “I’m that sicksadistic fucking twisted bitch” on “ZAD DRUMZ,” he’s wearing hisdarkness for all to see. If you listen hard enough, you can almosthear James Baldwin saying, “To be a Negro in this country and to berelatively conscious is to be in a rage almost all the time.”LESS IS MOOR lets you into this rage so you can dance with it.</p>
